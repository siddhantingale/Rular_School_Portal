I want you to build a full-stack Automated Attendance System for Rural Schools with the following requirements:

⚙️ Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js + TailwindCSS (responsive, mobile-first).

Backend: Node.js + Express.js.

Database: MongoDB (cloud) + IndexedDB/LocalStorage (for offline sync).

Authentication: JWT-based login for Admin and Teachers.

Reports: Export attendance in PDF/Excel.

Extras: PWA support (so it works on mobile offline).

📌 Core Features
1. Authentication

Separate login for Admin (Headmaster) and Teachers.

Students are added by Admin/Teacher (no login for students).

Secure login with JWT.

2. Attendance Methods

Facial Recognition

Use Python + OpenCV or TensorFlow.js API integration.

Capture student face via webcam/mobile camera.

Match with stored student photos.

RFID Card Attendance

Each student has an RFID/NFC card.

Attendance is marked when card is scanned.

Manual Attendance

Teacher can mark present/absent manually (checkbox list).

3. User Roles & Dashboards
🔑 Admin Dashboard

Add/Edit/Delete Teachers.

Add/Edit/Delete Students (name, roll no, class, photo, RFID).

View all attendance reports.

Generate/export PDF/Excel reports.

Multi-language option (English/Hindi/Marathi).

👨‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard

View class summary.

Submit attendance daily.

Notifications for absentees.

👩‍🎓 Student Profile

4. Reports Page

Daily/Weekly/Monthly attendance reports.

Exportable in PDF/Excel.

Filter by class, student, teacher, date.

5. Settings Page

Switch offline mode ON/OFF.

Sync data when internet is available.

📌 Backend API Endpoints

📌 Extra Requirements

Offline-first: Store attendance locally and sync when online.

Low-cost, user-friendly UI: Suitable for rural schools with minimal training
